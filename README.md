# Mutant_Testing
Mutation Testing on a subject requires mutants to be generated, which are automated in this project using Elitist 
genetic algorithm.The test suite is reduced by applying the weighted set cover algorithm over it.
This technique provides us with reduced test suite and also prioritizes the test cases.
Tools/Language/ used : Unix and C++
